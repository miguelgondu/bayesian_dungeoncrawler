<p class="justify">Adaptive Roguelike applies an approach called <a class="printit" href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nando.defreitas/publications/BayesOptLoop.pdf" target='_blank'>Bayesian Optimization</a> to model the time it takes you to solve differently challenging levels. If you want to find out more about the technology behind it, <a class="printit" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.07677" target='_blank'>read our paper</a>.</p>

<p class="justify">We collect anonymous data about which levels you solve, how long it takes for you to solve them and your playtrace. We do not collect any personal data.</p>

<p class="justify">The sprites for this game were taken and adapted from <a class="printit" href="https://kenney.nl/" target="_blank">Kenney's</a>.</p>
